% Language, Encoding and Fonts

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Select encoding of your inputs. Depends on
% your operating system and its default input
% encoding. Typically, you should use
%   Linux  : utf8 (most modern Linux distributions)
%            latin1 
%   Windows: ansinew
%            latin1 (works in most cases)
%   Mac    : applemac
% Notice that you can manually change the input
% encoding of your files by selecting "save as"
% an select the desired input encoding. 
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
% Make latex understand and use the typographic
% rules of the language used in the document.
\usepackage[english]{babel}
% Use the vector font Latin Modern which is going
% to be the default font in latex in the future.
\usepackage{helvet}
% Change the default font family from roman to sans serif
\renewcommand{\familydefault}{\sfdefault} % for text

\begin{posterbox}[name=intro,column=0,row=0]{Era of Many-core Chips}
Hundreds of cores integrated on chip:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Technology scaling.
  \item 3D integration.
  \item Several examples:
  \begin{itemize}
      \item STMicro P2012/STHORM 
      \item picoChip 
      \item Scale-out
      
      \item Tilera Tile GX, Tile Pro 
      \item Intel Polari 
  \end{itemize}
  \item Complex apps, stringent constraints:
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Massively parallel applications
      \item Performance, power, scalability, reliability are key challenges.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{posterbox}[name=demand,column=0, below=3dnoc]{Reliability Demand}
\begin{itemize}
    \item NoCs are exposed to a variety of manufacturing and design factors making them vulnerable to different faults that cause corrupted message transfer or even catastrophic system failures.
    \item The single-point-failure nature of NoC introduces a big concern to their reliability as they are the sole communication medium. 
    \item Several works have dealt with separated types of faults; however, there is a demand of a comprehensively reliable 3D NoC system which can handle soft errors, hard faults and TSV defects.
\end{itemize}
